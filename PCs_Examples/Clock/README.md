Two alternative descriptions of the classical CSP process <i>Clock</i>:
* One version is more compact (<i>PC_Clock</i>); it avoids the explicit gray reference node (used in <i>PC_Clock_ref</i>).
* Both versions result in exactly the same CSP.

In addition, there is the faulty clock PC, which either ticks or breaks down.
